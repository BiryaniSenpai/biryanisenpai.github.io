You,

I write to you, once more, to tell you that things do not just fall into place. Every change demands constant, active effort.

Of all the sins I have committed, inaction has to be the most destructive. It erodes me, it erodes you, and it erodes everyone around us.  It also defines the little constancy that remains in us.

I do not seek your magnanimity. I only ask that you learn to live with me, for, as fate would have it, you have no other choice.

You washed your face in my waters; now, quench me.

-- Yours
