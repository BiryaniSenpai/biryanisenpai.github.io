You,

I forsook you today. In truth, it happened yesterday, and the days before that, too.

We paint pictures, draw lines, and blush — oh, the folly of love! But we’re not 16 anymore. We should know better by now.

Our contingency shall not persist, our existence only extends to repaying conditional favours.

We fill each other with each other, and somehow that relieves us.

Make of this what you will.

-- Yours
